# This is a fork of the Graphcoin github

This is done to correct the problem with
the stagnant blockchain. 


To use the wallet, you need to git clone this, and 
follow the directions in the doc folder, to
build the new wallet. 

And please - if you like what I am doing for the coin - donate 
some GRPH coins to me: gH4gBYLNnxN7S4RjhajbVqmoZTuqH8D1U2
